This is a DB based slow control system for particle and particle-astrophysics experiments. Used on LUX, DEAP-1, and (*)CLEAN. There are three parts, a php based web front end, a C based back end and a MySQL database.

Contains 2 directories, 

SC_Web  -- the php based front end

SC_backend -- the C backend code and documentation



The SC_Web directory should just be copied into your http server directory, then edit the config files to match your configuration.
